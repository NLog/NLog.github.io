title: NLog 4.4 is live!
---

NLog 4.4 contains new features, performance improvements and makes it easier 
to write custom components (e.g. targets, layout renderers) for NLog!

A lot of stuff has been contributed by the community! Thanks for making NLog great!

## Main features

### WebServiceTarget support for JSON & XML 
The WebServiceTarget was always a bit odd as it was posting the data Form-encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded).
This has now been fixed with the support for JSON and XML, just pick one!

Example

```xml
<target type='WebService'
        name='ws'
        url='http://localhost:1234/logme'
        protocol='JsonPost' 
        encoding='UTF-8'   >
    <parameter name='param1' type='System.String' layout='${message}'/> 
    <parameter name='param2' type='System.String' layout='${level}'/>
</target>
```



### Injecting JSON serializer into NLog

With the support of JSON in the WebServiceTarget, it can be important to give the opportunity 
to choose your JSON serializer implementation. 
This implementation will be also used for all other JSON serialization in NLog, like the JsonLayout.

We really like JSON.NET, but we don't like to depend on it! It's a great library, 
but it can lead to issues with strong names and other versions in your project. 
See also [the statement of RestSharp library](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/restsharp/yjGCtOnEYHk/XbKZi0yjN8cJ) (which is also a great library)  

So we now have our own implementation, which is sufficient for most cases. 

Do you like to choose your implementation? Implement `SerializeObject(..)` in `IJsonSerializer` and set it to `ConfigurationItemFactory.JsonSerializer`.

### JSON layout support for all-event-properties

The JsonLayout has two new properties which will help you creating better JSON documents: 

- includeAllProperties: Include all events properties of a logevent? default: false. Introduced in NLog 4.4
- excludeProperties: comma separated string with names which properties to exclude. Only used when includeAllProperties is true. Case sensitive. Default empty When a name contains a comma, single quote the value. E.g. 'value,withquote',value2. Introduced in NLog 4.4

Example:

```xml
<layout xsi:type="JsonLayout" includeAllProperties="true" excludeProperties="BadPropertyName1, BadProperty2">
    <field name="message" layout="My message for you is this ${message}" />
</layout>
```

### Don't stop logging when there is something wrong in the layout
Previously, if you made an error in a layout, e.g. typos:

```xml
 <target name="file" xsi:type="File"
            layout="${message} ${oops-I-made-a-typo}" >
```

or just using a layout renderer from a non-included package, nothing got logged!

This is unneccesary and we are skipping the invalid parts now. The invalid parts are replaced with an empty string.

NB: If `throwExceptions` or `throwConfigExceptions` is `true`, there will be still an error thrown



### Lamba Function layout renderers
Layout renders (those things between `${}`) can help you writing context information.

Since NLog 4.4 there is a new way to create a custom layout renderer, which can be written on one line!

The new `LayoutRenderer.Register` accepts a lamba function, 
which accepts 1 or 2 parameters and should return a `string`.

- 1 parameter: the `logEventInfo`.
- 2 parameters: `logEventInfo` and the current NLog config.

Examples 

```c#
//register ${text-fixed}
LayoutRenderer.Register("test-fixed", (logEvent) => "2");

//register ${trace-identifier}
LayoutRenderer.Register("trace-identifier", (logEvent) => HttpContext.Current.TraceIdentifier);

//Using logEventInfo, ${message-length}
LayoutRenderer.Register("message-length", (logEvent) => logEvent.Message.Length);

//Using config, ${targetCount}
LayoutRenderer.Register("targetCount",(logEvent, config) => config.AllTargets.Count);
```

See [the wiki](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/How%20to%20write%20a%20custom%20layout%20renderer)

### Make it easier to register custom layout / target / layoutrendeners

There is a new syntax introduced so it's easier to register your custom extensions:

```c#
//target
Target.Register<MyNamespace.MyFirstTarget>("MyFirst"); //generic
Target.Register("MyFirst", typeof(MyNamespace.MyFirstTarget)); //OR, dynamic

//layout renderer
LayoutRenderer.Register<MyNamespace.MyFirstLayoutRenderer>("MyFirst"); //generic
LayoutRenderer.Register("MyFirst", typeof(MyNamespace.MyFirstLayoutRenderer)); //dynamic

//layout
Layout.Register<MyNamespace.CsvLayout>("csv"); //generic
Layout.Register("csv", typeof(MyNamespace.CsvLayout)); //dynamic
```

For more info, see [the wiki](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Register%20your%20custom%20component)


### Collection types for custom extensions

Custom Targets, layout etc. can have properties. There are only limitations if you'd like to set them from the XML config.

The following types are supported:

#### Allowed types
Allowed types for Targets, Layouts and Layout renderers.

- C# types: e.g. bool, char, decimal, double, float, int, uint, etc.
- Enums (use short name)
- `Encoding`
- `CultureInfo`
- `Type`
- `LineEndingMode` 
- `Uri`
- NLog types: `Layout`, `SimpleLayout` & `ConditionExpression`
- Types which has an implicit conversion from `string`
- Types which are using `TypeDescriptor` from `string` (not Silverlight)
- Collections, introduced in NLog 4.4. See section [Collection types](#user-content-collection-types])




#### Collection types
Introduced in NLog 4.4, the following collection types can be used.

Usage in XML: comma separated string. If the value contains a comma, single quote the whole value.

Examples:

- `value="one arg"`
- `value="1,2"`
- `value="value1,'value2,  with comma'"`

Collections of type: 

  -  `IList<T>` / `IList`
  - `IEnumerable<T>` / `IEnumerable` 
  - `ISet<T>` / `HashSet<T>`

with the following types: 

  - C# built in types (string, int, double, object)
  - enum (use short name)
  - culture, encoding, Type
  - not supported: Layout

Not supported:

- Arrays
- Non-generic `List` 
- Non-gereric `IList`
- Custom class implementing/inheriting from the collection classes/interfaces. (because of performance)


PS: .NET 3.5 has `HashSet` but no `ISet`

### Added condition to AutoFlushWrappper
Something you would like to flush in special cases only, e.g. sending a mail when there is an error.
Of course you would like to have the trace logs in your mail too, as that can help identifying the problem!

This is now possible by using the `Condition` property on `AutoFlushWrappper`

Example:

```xml
<target name="file" xsi:type="AutoFlushWrapper" condition="level >= LogLevel.Error">
  <target xsi:type="BufferingWrapper" ..>
    <target name="gmail" xsi:type="Mail"
            smtpServer="smtp.gmail.com"
            smtpPort="587"
            smtpAuthentication="Basic"	   
      
	/>
  </target>
</target>
```


### LimitingTargetWrapper 
Like sending mail but not every 10 seconds? 
With the LimitingTargetWrapper you can control the maximum events per interval.

Example, max 5 messages per 10 minutes

```xml
<target name='limiting' type='LimitingWrapper' messagelimit='5' interval='0:10:00'>
 <target name="gmail" xsi:type="Mail"
            smtpServer="smtp.gmail.com"
            smtpPort="587"
            smtpAuthentication="Basic"	   
      
	/>
</target>
```


### WindowsMultiProcessFileAppender
In Windows there is a new file writing implementation. From tests we have 10-40% performance increase! 


### WebServiceTarget & ${UrlEncode} - Added standard support for UTF8 encoding, added support for RFC2396 & RFC3986
The URL encoding for the WebServiceTarget was not behaving to any RFC as far as we know. 
This has been changed!

For the WebServiceTarget & `${UrlEncode}`, 
NLog will by default encode parameters as UTF8 and escape special characters according to Rfc2396.

Also the following properties have been added to WebServiceTarget & `${UrlEncode}`

- escapeDataRfc3986 - To escape data according to standard Rc3986, set this option to `true` 
- escapeDataNLogLegacy - To escape data according to the old non-standard NLog style, set this option to `true`


## Other additions and changes

- `${exception}` - Added support for `AggregateException`
- Keeping variables during configuration reload (optional)
- Layout processinfo with support for custom Format-string
- DetectConsoleAvailable on (colored)Console disabled by default
- Callsite: added includeNamespace option

### Bugfixes:

- Writing to the same file from multiple processes does not function when archiving with `concurrentWrites="true"` and `keepFileOpen="true"`
- NLog throws ConfigurationErrorsException when appsettings has invalid XML.


### Other:

- Improved `[Obsolete]` warnings - include the Nlog version when it became obsolete
- FileTarget - Close stale file handles outside archive mutex lock #1513
